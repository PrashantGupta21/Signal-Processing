(b) The sqaure pulse function is an even funtion so we observe the real frequency spectrum and
    imaginary part is zero. The absolute graph is the modulus of frequency spectrum, and phase 
    graph showing the angle shift of that frequency.


(c) The variation in time verify the time shift property of fourier transform :- 
    x(at)⟷(1/|a|)*X(ωa), where 'a' is some constant.
    The graph for T=1 has lower peak amplitude and lesser number of peaks, while the graph
    for T=4 has higher peak amplitude and higher number of peaks compared to the graph of T=2.

(d) The cos(t) even function has an even fourier transform, and the complex function exp(1i*t)
    has a real fourier transform coefficient, with offset peak at ω = 1.

(e) The triangular pulse can be represented as the convolution of two identical rectangular waves,
    and this can be verified by the convolution property of fourier transform :-
    x(t)∗y(t)⟷(1/2π)*X(ω).Y(ω), where x(t) and y(t) are identical square wave from [-1 1] of step 1.
